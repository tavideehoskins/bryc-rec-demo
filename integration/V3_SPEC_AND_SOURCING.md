# BRYC Recommendation v3 — Data Sourcing Spec (AS BUILT) + Handoff

**For:** Daryl & Cameron (porting v3 into the production recommendation engine).
**Companion:** `BRYC_Rec_v3_Build_Plan.md`. **Live demo:** https://tavideehoskins.github.io/bryc-rec-demo/

Field-by-field sourcing for the v3 output **as actually built**, down to file / column, Notion
profile, or existing engine module — including every deviation from the original v3 spec.
**Rule (honored): every field traces to a named authoritative source in the repo or a Notion
profile. Nothing is guessed. If a field has no source it is omitted from the student view (no
placeholder) and flagged on the advisor side.**

All file references verified against the repo on **2026-06-29**; the **2-year parity refresh**
(§ "v3.1") verified **2026-06-30**. The prototype hardcodes values in `data.cljs`, but every field
name mirrors its source, so production wiring is field→source.

---

## What v3 built (deltas vs the v2 single-school Colleges view)

1. **Three-tab menu** — `Colleges` · `Short-Term` · `Scholarships` (in-page state; no routing).
2. **Second college in Colleges** — Baton Rouge Community College (BRCC, 2-year/CTE) alongside SLU.
3. **Six sourced sample records**: associate of science (ASN nursing), technical associate (Industrial Production Tech),
   transfer associate (Business LA Transfer), certificate (LPN), apprenticeship (BR Electrical JATC),
   and 3 scholarships.
4. **New per-type sections**: Time & Completion, Transfer Plan, Cost & Funding, Earn While You Learn.
5. **As-built deviations from the original spec (call-outs):**
   - **BRCC is not in PSEO** → all BRCC samples show the **LWC occupation wage** (labeled
     occupation-level), not a program-earnings chart.
   - **Scholarships** use the in-repo `career_onestop_louisiana_final_4036.csv.gz` (the spec's
     `scholarships_v2_…csv` lives in the Obney `python/` repo, not the data mount).
   - **Time-to-degree (CMPLTTD) is institution-level only** (no CIP column) → shown as a
     school-wide figure; **program-level completions added separately from CMPLRACE**.
   - **Apprenticeship wage progression IS in the repo** (PROG `starting`/`average-income-hourly`)
     — so it's shown, not deferred.
   - **Transfer→bachelor's completion is NOT shown** — no school-specific source in the repo
     (national NSC numbers aren't true for BRCC); kept as an acquisition item.
   - **Logos** are domain-derived (favicon) with curated overrides — consistently attainable for any school.

## v3.1 — 2-year (BRCC) brought to FULL parity with 4-year (2026-06-30)

The first v3 cut gave 2-year/CTE schools a **minimal** About + simple cost (STR, grad-norm, campus
life, and the cost waterfall were suppressed). Per advisor feedback, the 2-year **About This School**
and **What It Costs You** are now sourced to the **same depth as the 4-year**, and the SAME components
render both (no `cte?` branch). **Every value below is institution-agnostic** — pulled from the same
per-school datasets used for SLU, so any recommended 2-year populates the same way.

| # | Change | As built (BRCC, UNITID 437103) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Tuition now from BOR, not Scorecard** | Tuition & **fees $4,419** (resident) replaces Scorecard tuition-only $3,237 | **BORFEE** `SummaryUGrad` (calibrated: SLU col = known $9,043) |
| 2 | **PSEO-first made explicit** | Precedence is **PSEO whenever present, LWC only as fallback**; BRCC has no PSEO row → LWC occupation wage | code + PSEO scan (BRCC absent) |
| 3 | **Graduation rate, sector-normed** | **31%** (3-yr / 150%-time) vs **LA public 2-yr avg 30.3%** → **+0.7 → "Medium"** | **GR** `gr2024` 2-yr cohort: 299 completers ÷ 964 (GRTYPE 30/29); peers {BRCC 31.0, River Parishes 29.6} |
| 4 | **Transfer data in About This School** | **17%** transfer-out (≈167 of 964, within 3 yrs) | **GR** `gr2024` transfer-out (GRTYPE 35 / CHRTSTAT 22) |
| 5 | **Cost waterfall** (parity w/ 4-yr) | direct costs **$5,719** → after TOPS-Tech **$2,633** → **$0 out of pocket** (after Pell) | BORFEE T&F $4,419 + books $1,300; TOPS-Tech $3,086; Pell $7,395. **Off-campus living EXCLUDED** (an allowance, not a school charge) → aid ($10,481) covers all direct costs |
| 6 | **Enrollment + retention** | UG **11,182**, **Black/AfAm 56.9%** (6,359), **retention 53%** | **EF** `ef2024a` (`EFTOTLT`/`EFBKAAT`); `ef2024d` `RET_PCF` |
| 7 | **Transfer associate now shows TIME** | Business (LA Transfer) shows school-wide **≈4.6 yr** alongside its **56** completers | **TTD** institution-level (applies to the transfer associate too) |
| 8 | **Avg debt OMITTED for 2-yr** | no bullet — Scorecard per-borrower ($5,204) reads misleadingly low; no in-repo cumulative figure | acquisition (IPEDS cumulative debt for 2-yrs) |

**Grad-rate norm caveat (acquisition):** the in-repo LA roster (`PROG` + `BRIDGE`) resolves only **2**
public 2-years (BRCC, River Parishes), so the "statewide 2-yr average" is thin. Completing the LCTCS
roster (finish `bor_ipeds_bridge.csv`, or add the IPEDS HD directory for a LA-public-2-yr filter)
widens the peer set; the mechanism is unchanged.

## Transferability mechanisms (as built)

- **Per-record `:sections`** — each program declares which sections render; falls back to the 4-year default. Add/remove by data, not code.
- **Salary is PSEO-FIRST** — `:earnings` (PSEO program-level) is used **whenever present**; the `:occupation` LWC occupation-wage chart is the **fallback only** when PSEO isn't published for that school×program (labeled occupation-level). Institution-agnostic precedence.
- **School-anchored About + Cost are one data-driven path** *(v3.1)* — the SAME `about-school-section` / `costs-section` render 4-year and 2-year; what shows is driven by the fields the school record carries (acceptance/ACT when selective; transfer-out + open-admission copy otherwise). No school-type branch.
- **Grad-rate norm is sector-aware, per-school** *(v3.1)* — each school carries its own `:grad-rate {rate, normed-against, peer-average, delta, indicator}`. Mechanism = IPEDS rate vs mean of **same-sector** LA public peers (4-yr: size-banded; 2-yr: statewide). High ≥+5 / Low ≤−5 / Med.
- **Transfer-out** *(v3.1)* — `:transfer-out` (IPEDS GR) renders in About This School when present (community colleges); omitted otherwise.
- **Cost waterfall is generic** *(v3.1)* — reads `:tuition-fees` / **optional** `:living`+`:living-label` / `:books` / `:coa` / `:tops`+`:tops-name` / `:pell` / `:net` / optional `:avg-debt` / `:commuter?` / `:fully-covered?`; axis scales to COA. A residential school includes `:living` (on-campus room & board, a real charge); a **commuter school omits `:living`** so the COA is school-charged direct costs only. When aid ≥ COA the net shows **$0 out of pocket**. Same chart for both school types.
- **Chips** — derived per-program from `:field` (CIP title), `:credential-level` (award level), `:lwc-stars` (≥4 → "High demand").
- **Logos** — curated asset OR domain favicon (any school).
- **STR / Open Admission** — classifier on ACT vs 25/75; no ACT → "Open Admission".
- **Conditional fields** — every discipline-specific field omitted when `nil` (e.g. avg-debt for 2-yrs, PUMS below a bachelor's).

## Data we do NOT have in the repo — acquisition items + authoritative source

|---|---|---|
| **Transfer→bachelor's *completion*, school-specific** | Transfer Associate | CCRC *Tracking Transfer* / NSC StudentTracker (national NSC is **not** school-specific — not shown). NB transfer-*out* rate (17%) **is** shown from IPEDS GR. |
| **Complete LA public 2-year roster** (for the grad-rate norm) *(v3.1)* | 2-year norm | finish `bor_ipeds_bridge.csv` UNITID mapping, or add IPEDS HD directory (filter LA + public + 2-yr). In-repo roster currently resolves only 2 colleges. |
| **Cumulative debt at graduation, 2-year** *(v3.1)* | 2-year cost | IPEDS / College Scorecard institution cumulative debt (Scorecard per-borrower loan-average is misleadingly low — debt bullet omitted for 2-yrs) |
| **Program-level time-to-degree** | All associate/cert | BOR SSPS unit-record / institution IR (CMPLTTD is institution-level only) |

## Display & missing-data rules (student-facing)

1. **No placeholders.** Any field without a source is omitted entirely — no `[DATA NOT FOUND]`, no empty rows.
2. **Earnings chart degrades** — full Y1/Y5/Y10 only where PSEO has it; otherwise the **LWC occupation-wage** chart, labeled occupation-level (BRCC samples).
3. **Cost helper** ("school hasn't published pricing — contact them") is retained for unreported short-term tuition — content, not a placeholder.
4. **PUMS** never appears below a bachelor's.
5. **2-year ≠ suppressed** *(v3.1)* — 2-year schools get the SAME About + Cost depth as 4-year: STR → "Open Admission", but the **grad-rate norm (sector-aware), transfer-out, enrollment/retention, and the full cost waterfall ARE shown**. Only residential **campus life** (no URL) and **PUMS** (non-bachelor's) are absent — by data, not by school type.
6. **Time vs completions** — time-to-degree is school-wide (CMPLTTD; applies to the transfer associate too); completers/year is program-specific (CMPLRACE); each is labeled with its scope.
7. **Advisor side keeps every gap visible** (`[DATA NOT FOUND — Advisor Verify]` in the Notion draft + Advisor Review Notes) so omission is never silently lossy.

## Build & integration
```bash
cd ui/advising-hub
npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./src/css/main.css -o ./rec-demo-site/main.css --minify
npx shadow-cljs -A:dev release rec-demo      # → rec-demo-site/js/main.js
```
Apply `integration/rec-ui-redesign.patch` (`git apply`) + copy `assets/` into `rec-demo-site/assets/`.
Field names in `data.cljs` mirror the sources above → production wiring is field→source, not a rewrite.
The Transfer Plan `:outcomes` render is built but dormant — drop in a per-UNITID transfer-outcomes
file and it lights up.
